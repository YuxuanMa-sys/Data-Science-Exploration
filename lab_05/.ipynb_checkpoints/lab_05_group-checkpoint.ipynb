    "\n",
    "#### Target Population Identification\n",
    "Suppose that you own an Etsy store and you are interested in advertising your products online. You have already conducted quite a lot of research, identifying a large population of people (along with their corresponding browser ids) that would be *most* likely to buy your product. We call this the **target population**. You decide to only advertise to these people in the target population with online ads. \n",
    "\n",
    "*(If you're interested to learn more about you would do this, STAT430-Unsupervised Learning can be a useful class).*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online Advertising Effectiveness\n",
    "From your prior research, you have determined that once a person in the target population has been exposed to an online ad for your product, there is a 20% chance that they will actually buy the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inventory Decisions\n",
    "Unfortunately, your product can only be made in 'batches' of size 4. So once, you have sold your fourth product, you would need to stop your advertising campaign to make another batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Defining a Random Variable</u>\n",
    "To help us learn more about our advertising campaign, let's define a random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "**X = the number of people in the target population that you have to advertise your product to until FOUR of these people have purchased your product.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. [2.5 pt] <u>Simulation Design</u>\n",
    "Design and execute a simulation that randomly generates a **SINGLE** value for this random variable X that we defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: You might find the dataframe created below useful in your simulation. What is the probability of randomly sampling a person from this 'simulated_pop' that has purchased the product? What is the probabilty of randomly sampling a person from this 'simulated_pop' that has not purchased the product?*"
